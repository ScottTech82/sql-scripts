SQL DATABASES
        DDL -Data Definition Language
            (Chapter 11 thru .. )

CHAPTER 11 (page 335)

    Intro to DDL.
        Will need to use create SQL Statements to build a database.
        CANNOT use SSMS to build a databaseand Nor Azure Data Studio.

    CREATE 
        Create DATABASE <give it a name>
        Create Table <name>

    DROP  -is delete
        Drop database <name>
        Drop Table <name>
    
    ALTER  -modifies the data
        Alter Table
        Alter Function.

    Other statements;
        Sequence deals with primary keys and foreign keys
        Function - we covered, but you can create specific functions.
        Procedure - scripts that we can create and execute.
        Triggers -forget about, will never do.
        View -query that you want to store in the database.
                    Join 4 tables, save it and it becomes a specific view.

Rules for Object names

    As in Database names or Table names, they have specific Rules
    the first character can be Underscore _ or @ or #.  (@Vendors Table)
    Cannot start it with a number.  (cannot do 1Vendors Table)

    Dont make the names too short or too long.
    1,2,or3 words slammed together is good.

    Cant be Transact-SQL reserved keyword like SELECT, UPDATE, FROM, etc.

CREATE DATABASE

    Create database <name>
        we are not using the [On [Primary] (Filename = 'file_name')] 
        Just create database <name>

        POINT to the Master database and not one of the other databases.

Use Master;
    means if I am not in the master database make sure to change to 
    master to run the script.

DROP Database IF EXISTS
    Will drop it if it exists or nothing.

Creating Tables

<Open the Bootcamp DB Creation Script for example>

    use master;

    Drop Database if exists Bootcamp;

    Create Database Bootcamp;

    Use Bootcamp;

    Create Table Students(
        StudentID Int NOT NULL Primary Key Identity(1, 1),
        <List out the rest of the colums needed>
    );
    
    Create Table GraduationRequirements (
        ID int Not Null Primary Key Identity(1, 1),
        StudentID int Not Null Foreign Key References Students(StudentID),
        <List out the rest of the columns needed>
    );

Primary Key makes it unique, does not need to be in sequence. 
        make sure PK has no relation to data point to, like last name may change.

Create Table <name> (column-name datatype[string, int, etc] null Primary Key Identity(1, 1))
                    --Primary Key identity(first number 1, increments of 1) -can be anything we want.

Forgein Key must match the same table format as the primary key.
        StudentID int Not Null Primary Key Identity(1, 1)
        StudentID int Not Null Foreign Key References Students(StudentID),
                --Need to use the References then PK Table(column)

In Azure Studio you can use Shift+Alt+Down Arrow to copy/past a section.
        Then you can use Ctrl+Alt+Down Arrow to get Multiple Cursors and change 
        a bunch of lines all at once!!
